calculator.py evaluates mathematical expressions. Example calculations:
==> 3.1 + 4.1
7.20000000000
==> pi % 1
0.141592653590
==> sin(pi / 4)
0.7071067811862305
The order of operations is what it should be. You can nest parentheses as deep as you want, but don't use square brackets [] or curly braces {}, as Python sees these as having special meanings.
If you want to use the functionality of calculator.py in a different module, I would suggest importing everything (so that you can use all defined operations), and then using the calc() method (which is where the magic happens).
To see a full list of all operations that you can perform on numbers, run:
python .\calculator.py --ops
Currently this calculator does not support complex numbers, and will give up if you try to square root a negative number.

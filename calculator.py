I want to make a Python calculator around the eval() function.
All numbers should be handled as Decimals. This prevents nasty floating point imprecision.

TODO:
* Variables seem to be working, but I want '7x' to evaluate to 7 times the value of x rather than a variable named _7x (if creating the var) or 7 concatenated to x (if referencing the var). This will mean that variable names will NOT be allowed to have numbers ANYWHERE in them (otherwise it is impossible to tell if 'foo3bar' is one, two, or three values). (The only alternative would be to check when saving each var if its name is contained in another var, and rejecting it if so, but this sounds labour intensive, and I think the outcome is worse.)
* Make a factorize or unmultiply function.
* Once you get most of the other things working, I would like to be able to map keys on my keyboard to different things so that I do not have to use all of keys around the edge to type in a mathematical expression. (I don't know if there would be a good way to do this, though.)
* math domain error is handled in sqrt(), but also needs to be handled in log().
So I don't think I understand this completely, but I think that, because of the way I am using Decimals, they are imprecise, and therefore offer no clear advantage over just using floats. This is because I am allowing eval() to convert a string like '-2' or '3 + 5' into the number -2 and 8, respectively, before Decimal() ever gets a hold of them. I need to find a way to turn all numbers into decimals before anything else happens to them.
* Consider transforming (...)! into factorial(...).
